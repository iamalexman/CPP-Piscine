# CPP-Piscine
The C++ Piscine is the next step in the 42 Curriculum. I discovered more about OOP by learning specifics of the C++ language. Successfully completing this challenge will unlock the object-oriented projects and prepare me for future objectives and jobs.

### Run:
Each day of the Piscine and each task of the day contains a Makefile with a test main. To run the project you can type "make" in the console. Also, each day of the Piscine contains an assembled Xcode project, and you can choose to run it if that makes you feel more comfortable.
