# CPP-Piscine

The C++ Piscine is the next step in the 42 Curriculum. I discovered more about OOP by learning specifics of the C++ language. Successfully completing this challenge will unlock the object-oriented projects and prepare me for future objectives and jobs.

### Description:
#### * Day00: Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const, and some other basic
stuff
#### * Day01: Memory allocation, pointers to members, references, switch statement
#### * Day02: Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading and Orthodox Canonical class form
#### * Day03: Inheritance
#### * Day04: Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces
#### * Day05: Repetition and Exceptions
#### * Day06: C++ Casts
#### * Day07: C++ templates
#### * Day08: Templated containers, iterators, algorithms

### Run:
Each day of the Piscine and each task of the day contains a Makefile with a test main. To run the project you can type "make" in the console (I use C++98 and clang compiler). Also, each day of the Piscine contains an assembled Xcode project, and you can choose to run it if that makes you feel more comfortable.
